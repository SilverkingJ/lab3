  <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The enduring image of the Kansas City Chiefs’ first home playoff victory in 25 years will be quarterback Patrick Mahomes diving into the pile to help shove Darrel Williams the last few inches into the end zone for a game-clinching touchdown.

Mahomes wasn’t born the last time the Chiefs won a postseason game at Arrowhead Stadium before Saturday afternoon.

But Mahomes — the 23-year-old wunderkind quarterback, who became the second QB in NFL history with 50 touchdowns and 5,000 yards passing in a season — helped exorcise a quarter-century of demons, throwing for 278 yards and rushing for a touchdown during a 31-13 dismantling of the Indianapolis Colts at Arrowhead Stadium.

The Chiefs’ much-maligned defense forced four consecutive three-and-outs to start the game, while the Mahomes-led offense raced to a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter.
